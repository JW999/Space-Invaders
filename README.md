# Space-Invaders
[Under development] A simple game I made to learn python

*NOTE: You need to have pygame installed in order to play this game.*

To play the game, run spaceInvaders.py. Use the arrow keys to move the ship, space key to fire at aliens, and finally q to quit. Enjoy :)

This tutorial is based upon a pygame tutorial found in a book called "Python crash course".

TO DO list:

  1. Add a scoring system. 

  2. ~~Add a "play again" button.~~

  3. Add a starting screen(some sort of intro and a splash screen). **A play button has been added, splash screen will soon follow.**

  4. Add new aliens.

  5. Allow the aliens to shoot.

  6. Add shelters for the ship.
